# Chapter 20 — Problem Solving and Expectations Need Human Calibration
*Two proposals arrived a week apart, and André Boucher is slowly realizing they are the same proposal.*

Problem-solving teaching (0.68) and teacher expectations (0.43) look like an odd couple until you see the shared mechanism: both are calibration problems. The first calibrates difficulty against what a learner can almost do; the second calibrates belief against what a learner could do — and Hattie's synthesis shows miscalibration in either direction carries real cost. AI can inform both calibrations with better evidence than teachers have ever had. It cannot own either one, because premature certainty — the model's natural register — is exactly the failure mode that destroys both mechanisms. The judgment stays human; the evidence pipeline doesn't have to.

The first came from his own teachers. The department is two years into a thinking-classrooms overhaul — non-routine problems, vertical whiteboards, students doing mathematics instead of watching it — and the bottleneck is task supply. Good non-routine problems are brutally expensive to write: rich enough to sustain struggle, accessible enough to start, with low floors and high ceilings. The teachers want to use a generative AI workflow to draft problem variants, anticipate misconceptions, and produce extension ladders. A task factory with humans doing quality control.

The second came from the district. Whitfield's new learning platform includes a "predicted proficiency" feature — a per-student forecast of end-of-year math performance, refreshed weekly — and the district's improvement office suggests teachers use it to differentiate problem-solving experiences: rich tasks for students predicted to handle them, scaffolded routines for students predicted to struggle.

André's unease has a precise shape. The first proposal uses AI to *raise* the demand on every student. The second uses AI to *predict* which students can handle demand — and routes the demand accordingly. One of these is calibration. The other is prophecy with a rubric. This chapter is about telling them apart.

## One Problem, Twice

This group collects two influences: problem-solving teaching (d = 0.68) and teacher expectations (d = 0.43). They look like an odd pair until you see what the dataset saw: both rows are *calibration problems*.

Problem-solving teaching works only when difficulty is tuned — struggle that is productive rather than crushing, help that arrives late enough to matter and early enough to prevent despair. Teacher expectations work only when beliefs are tuned — high enough to offer real demand, provisional enough to update on evidence. In both rows the tuning is the irreducibly human act. In both rows AI arrives with a strong opinion of its own.

That is the partial conflict flag. AI's default behavior — helpfulness on request, prediction from priors — pushes against each row's mechanism. An AI that helps a struggling student is doing what it was built to do and dismantling the struggle the task was built to produce. An AI that predicts a student's proficiency is doing what it was built to do and manufacturing the expectation the teacher was supposed to hold lightly.

The deep symmetry: both mechanisms die from premature certainty. The rescue is certainty about the *solution*. The prediction is certainty about the *student*. Calibration — of difficulty, of belief — is the practice of withholding certainty while the evidence is still arriving. Machines are bad at withholding; that is what they are for. So the humans must do it on purpose.

<!-- → [DIAGRAM: Two parallel calibration problems — left column "Problem-solving teaching": mechanism = calibrated productive struggle; AI default = helpfulness on request; conflict = rescue removes the struggle; right column "Teacher expectations": mechanism = tuned belief → opportunity allocation; AI default = prediction from priors; conflict = prediction manufactures the expectation; bottom row for both: "Calibration = withholding certainty while evidence arrives"] -->

## The Influences

**Problem-solving teaching (d = 0.68)** — rank 37. The influence is the *teaching* of problem solving — heuristics, strategy selection, planning and monitoring, the disciplined autopsy of failed attempts — not the mere assignment of problems. The lineage runs from Pólya's four phases through decades of strategy-instruction research, and the consistent finding is that students get better at solving unfamiliar problems when they are taught a repertoire of moves and given real problems on which to deploy them, with the deploying done by the student.

Liljedahl's thinking-classrooms research is the modern classroom translation: structures engineered to produce thinking by making non-thinking behaviors — mimicking, waiting for the takeover, stalling until the teacher solves it — structurally unavailable. The mechanism's fuel is productive struggle. The teacher's craft is keeping struggle productive.

**Teacher expectations (d = 0.43)** — rank 107. The d describes the association between what teachers expect and what students achieve, and the honesty notes come in a cluster. The founding study — Rosenthal and Jacobson's Pygmalion — is genuinely contested [contested — the original's psychometrics drew lasting criticism; replication produced a smaller, real effect concentrated in younger grades and stigmatized groups]. Much of the association is *accuracy*: teachers expect more from students who are in fact achieving more, so the arrow runs both ways.

The leverage is the causal slice, and the mediating channel is behavioral, not telepathic. Expectations become task rigor, wait time, question difficulty, feedback depth, warmth, and grouping. Rubie-Davies's work on high-expectation teachers shows the pattern at the teacher level: some teachers run high-demand, high-support classrooms for *everyone*, and their students — across the prior-achievement range — rise toward the demand. The influence is not "think nice thoughts." It is "allocate opportunity as if growth were the default."

The rows interlock at the point of André's unease: *who gets the rich task* is simultaneously a problem-solving decision and an expectations decision. Every routing of demand is a bet about a student, and the bets compound.

## Why the Struggle Must Stay Intact

The skill being built is what to do when you do not know what to do — and that skill is constructed only in its own presence. A student who is rescued at the first stall practices being rescued. The research grammar behind productive struggle is consistent: attempting before instruction, even attempting *wrong*, prepares the mind to learn from the resolution. The struggle generates the questions that the explanation then answers.

This is why the conflict flag sits on this row. The canonical evidence in this book is Bastani and colleagues' field experiment: unfettered GPT-4 access during practice inflated practice performance 48 percent and cut subsequent unassisted exam performance 17 percent — the machine absorbed the struggle, and with it the learning. The guardrailed tutor arm (+127 percent practice, approximately zero exam harm) showed that design, not abstinence, is the variable. An AI that solves on request, sitting open during problem-solving time, is a struggle-removal appliance.

But the same analysis locates AI's legitimate seat: *upstream* of the struggle. Writing the problem was never the student's cognitive work. Textbook authors did it for a century. Task design, variant generation, misconception anticipation, extension ladders — all of it is preparation that makes human-calibrated struggle possible at scale. The teacher's irreducible work happens *during*: reading the room's frustration, distinguishing productive friction from despair, delivering the smallest hint that restores motion, and running the whole-class debrief where strategies get named, compared, and turned into repertoire. That debrief — error processing, heuristic modeling — is where problems become problem-solving teaching, and the dataset is explicit that it stays human.

## The Prediction Problem

The expectations mechanism is opportunity allocation, which means it is auditable — expectations leave fingerprints in observable behavior: who got called on, who got the follow-up probe, who got the rich task versus the worksheet. This is where AI helps, because fingerprints are exactly the kind of distributed, high-volume pattern humans cannot see in themselves and machines count effortlessly.

And it is where AI harms, because a *predicted proficiency* column is a manufactured expectation with a weekly refresh — prior achievement laundered into prophecy and handed to the person whose openness was the influence. Route rich tasks by prediction and the loop closes by itself: the predicted-low student receives the scaffolded routine, never meets the demanding task, learns less of the problem-solving repertoire, performs as predicted, and the model — vindicated — predicts lower still. Chapter 18 called this the labeling machine. Here it has a curriculum attached.

<!-- → [DIAGRAM: Prediction loop — circular flow: "Student predicted low" → "Receives scaffolded routine" → "Less problem-solving repertoire built" → "Performs as predicted" → "Prediction updated lower" → back to start; adjacent to loop, linear chain showing high-expectation teacher alternative: "Demand for all" → "Support calibrated in the moment" → "Performance data updates belief provisionally" — student should see why the prediction loop is self-sealing in a way the teacher's provisional belief is not] -->

## What AI Can Safely Do

**Run the task factory.** Draft non-routine problems to specification — context, floor, ceiling, mathematical target. Generate variant families so groups get isomorphic-but-different problems. Produce extension ladders for early finishers. Teacher review remains the quality gate: a plausible-looking task with a degenerate solution path is this factory's hallucination mode.

**Anticipate the misconceptions.** For each task, generate the predictable wrong turns and what each one reveals — the teacher's pre-brief for hint calibration, replacing what only twenty years of experience used to supply.

**Equip the debrief.** Cluster student strategies from photographed whiteboards, suggest the sequence for sharing (concrete to abstract), draft the naming language for strategies students invented — preparation for the human-led discussion, never its replacement.

**Audit the allocation.** Count the fingerprints: who received which task tier, who got asked the extending question, wait-time patterns by student — surfaced privately to each teacher as a mirror. The dataset's hypothesized d ≈ 0.30 [HYPOTHESIS] for expectation work lives here: detection by machine, recalibration by human.

**Blind what can be blinded.** Strip names from work samples before grading and before task-routing decisions, where feasible — removing the expectancy channel from judgment rather than informing it.

## The Substitution Trap

**The rescue on demand.** AI access during problem-solving time, framed as support. Every "I'm stuck" becomes a solved step. Every solved step is repertoire the student did not build. The Bastani signature is already booked before the unit test reveals it. The trap is seductive at exactly Whitfield's vulnerability — struggle looks like unproductive classroom time to anyone watching through a window, and the AI makes the room look efficient. If the AI is reachable mid-struggle, the struggle is optional, and optional struggle is no struggle at all.

**The prophecy router.** Predicted proficiency deciding who gets the rich task. What makes it worse than old-fashioned tracking: it updates weekly, so it *feels* responsive. It is expressed in decimals, so it *feels* precise. Its training data is prior achievement, so it is prior achievement wearing a forecast's clothes. Differentiation-by-prediction inverts the high-expectation teacher's practice — demand for all, with support calibrated in the moment by a human watching *this* attempt, not a model summarizing last month's.

**The audit that becomes a verdict.** Even the expectations audit has a trap inside it: pattern reports on teachers, routed to evaluators instead of to the teachers themselves, convert a recalibration instrument into a surveillance instrument. Teachers, like students, perform differently under a label. The fingerprint data earns its keep only as a private mirror with a development conversation attached.

## The Case in Full

The department took both halves of André's realization to the leadership team. Whitfield ended up adopting one proposal, amputating the second, and salvaging its useful organ.

The task factory changed the department's economics within a month. A teacher who needed a low-floor, high-ceiling problem on proportional reasoning for Tuesday could have four candidate tasks, a misconception pre-brief, and three extensions by Monday afternoon — work that previously consumed a Sunday or simply didn't happen, defaulting the class back to the worksheet. Quality control earned its place fast: roughly one generated task in five had a flaw a teacher caught on review — a degenerate shortcut, an ambiguous condition, a context that quietly answered the question. The teachers began keeping a "kill log" of rejected tasks, which became unexpectedly the best professional development artifact of the year. Nothing teaches task design like autopsying machine failures together.

The proficiency router nearly slipped in through kindness. A seventh-grade teacher, overwhelmed mid-February, turned on the platform's "suggested grouping" — which quietly sorted her sections by the prediction column and assigned the rich tasks to the top two groups. For three weeks, eleven students predicted below proficiency received only scaffolded routine practice. What surfaced it was the department's own allocation audit: André's monthly report showed those eleven students' rich-task exposure at zero, a flat line nobody had chosen on purpose. The teacher's response became the department's catchphrase for the year: *"I didn't lower my expectations — I outsourced them."*

**The decision: four conditions.** The task workflow adopted department-wide: AI drafts, teachers gate, kill log maintained. AI unavailable to students during in-class problem solving — the struggle is the syllabus. Predicted-proficiency display disabled in all teacher-facing views; the underlying analytics feed one thing only: the monthly allocation audit, delivered privately to each teacher, discussed in pairs, never filed. Evidence check fixed for spring: unassisted performance on novel non-routine problems against the fall baseline, plus the allocation audit's equity trend — demand distributed by design, not by forecast.

## What Would Change My Mind

On the problem-solving half: replicated classroom evidence that well-designed AI tutoring during problem solving — attempt-gated, hint-laddered, answer-withholding — produces equal or better novel-problem transfer than human-calibrated struggle would move me from "AI out of the room" to "AI as the calibrated assistant." The Bastani guardrailed arm (+127/≈0) is honest grounds for thinking that experiment could someday succeed. The current gap is that approximately-zero exam harm is not the same as positive transfer of strategy repertoire, which no AI arm has yet demonstrated.

On the expectations half: evidence that prediction-informed routing, in practice, *raises* demand for low-prior students more often than it lowers it — the opposite of every tracking literature precedent — would rehabilitate the router. I would want the allocation audit, not the vendor, to be the witness.

## Still Puzzling

The hint ladder problem is unsolved in both species: human teachers also rescue too early, and Liljedahl documents it relentlessly. Is a well-tuned machine hint policy eventually *better* calibrated than a tired human's mercy at 1:45 p.m.? The honest answer is: possibly, and nobody has run the comparison against a thinking-classroom control.

Expectation effects concentrate in students who carry stigmatized labels — which means the audit matters most exactly where the data is sparsest and noisiest. Small-n mirrors mislead. How do you keep a per-teacher audit honest at classroom sample sizes?

The task factory's kill log made teachers better task designers. Does the factory eventually atrophy the same skill in the next generation of teachers, who will never write a task from scratch? The Tutor CoPilot question — does the assist build the assisted? — has a curriculum-side twin, and no one has measured either fading curve.

## Exercises

**Warm-up**

1. *(Recall — Two calibration problems)* The chapter claims both influences in this group are calibration problems. Explain what that means for each row: what is being calibrated in problem-solving teaching, what is being calibrated in teacher expectations, and why premature certainty destroys each mechanism.

2. *(Recall — Productive struggle)* The chapter draws on Bastani and colleagues to explain the partial conflict flag for problem-solving teaching. Summarize the relevant finding in two sentences, then explain what it implies about the design of a classroom where AI tools are available to students during problem-solving time.

3. *(Recall — Prediction loop)* Describe the self-sealing loop that forms when proficiency predictions are used to route task assignments. Name each step in the loop and explain why it is self-sealing — why the loop's output tends to confirm rather than test the initial prediction.

**Application**

4. *(Transfer — Task factory quality gate)* You are implementing the kill log from the case study in your department. An AI generates the following task for a seventh-grade unit on ratios: "A recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. If you use 9 cups of flour, how many cups of sugar do you need?" Evaluate this task as a gate, not a consumer. Does it have a low floor and high ceiling? Is there a degenerate solution path? Would it sustain productive struggle? Write your kill-log entry: keep, modify, or reject, with the reason a colleague could learn from.

5. *(Transfer — Allocation audit design)* You are designing the monthly private allocation audit from the case study for a department of eight teachers. Specify: what data the audit collects (which fingerprints), how it is delivered to each teacher, what the paired discussion protocol looks like, and what the trigger is for escalating a pattern finding to a department conversation rather than keeping it private.

6. *(Transfer — Disabling the router)* A district technology coordinator pushes back on André's condition disabling the predicted-proficiency display: "Teachers can just choose not to look at it — we don't need to hide it." Write a two-paragraph response arguing why the display must be technically disabled rather than left to teacher discretion. Use the expectation mechanism and the automation-bias literature from Chapter 11 in your argument.

**Synthesis**

7. *(Combine — Whole policy)* Design a complete implementation policy for an AI task-generation platform in a middle school mathematics department committed to thinking-classrooms practice. Your policy should address: task drafting and review protocol, the kill log, AI availability during class, the allocation audit, proficiency prediction handling, and the end-of-year evidence check. For each condition, name the trap it prevents and the mechanism it protects.

8. *(Combine — The guardrailed tutor question)* The chapter notes that the Bastani guardrailed arm (+127 percent practice performance, approximately zero exam harm) suggests that a well-designed in-class AI tutor might eventually produce positive novel-problem transfer. Design the experiment that would test this: what the guardrailed tutor would do and refuse to do, what the control condition is, what the outcome measure is (and why novel-problem transfer, not practice performance), and how long the study would need to run to distinguish strategy-repertoire building from practice fluency. Then identify the single hardest design problem your experiment faces.

**Challenge**

9. *(Open — The hint ladder reversal)* The Still Puzzling section raises the possibility that a well-tuned machine hint policy might be better calibrated than a tired human teacher's at 1:45 p.m. Construct the strongest possible argument that AI hint delivery during problem solving should eventually *replace* rather than merely inform human hint calibration — that the machine's consistency and error-history data make it the superior instrument. State the mechanism, identify the evidence that would confirm it, and name the falsification condition. Then evaluate honestly: what does the Liljedahl classroom-structure literature say about whether hint timing is the binding constraint, or whether the social and accountability structures of the thinking classroom are doing work that no hint policy — human or machine — can replicate?
