# Chapter 14 — Diagnosis, Intervention, and Teacher Learning Loops
*The loop that works is the one that closes through a person — and the tool that feels like a shortcut is usually cutting the load-bearing step.*

Three high-band influences — response to intervention (1.29), micro-teaching and video review (0.88), interventions for students with learning needs (0.77) — share one mechanism: a short, closed loop of diagnose, act, observe, adjust. Hattie's synthesis puts them near the top of the list because the loop, when it actually closes, compounds. AI fits naturally here as instrumentation — flagging, transcribing, pattern-surfacing — with medium risk and no direct conflict, because the loop's force comes from a teacher changing what they do next. The chapter's question is what happens when the instrumentation starts proposing the adjustments too.

Lauren Okafor coordinates MTSS at Brightwater Elementary, which means she chairs the intervention team: six educators, one conference table, and a Thursday meeting where the school decides, child by child, who needs more help and whether the help is working. This year the district bought her two pieces of AI at once.

The first is an early-warning and progress-monitoring platform: it ingests screening data, attendance, and intervention logs, flags students whose trajectories say *Tier 2 isn't holding*, and — the new feature — drafts a recommended tier placement and intervention package for each flagged child. The second landed in the principal's PLC budget: an AI lesson-video service that takes a recorded lesson and returns an analysis — talk-time ratios, question types, cold-call distribution, engagement estimates — plus a written summary of "strengths and growth areas," so teachers can skip the part everyone hates, which is watching themselves on camera.

Both tools point at the same Thursday table from opposite sides. One claims to accelerate the team's decisions about children. The other claims to accelerate the teachers' learning about themselves. The district's implementation memo uses the word "streamline" four times. Lauren has sat on intervention teams for eleven years, and she knows what the research behind RTI's enormous effect size actually rewards. She knows that "streamline" is sometimes a synonym for the exact step the effect size lives in.

## One Mechanism, Running Twice

This group collects three influences: response to intervention (d = 1.29), micro-teaching and video review of lessons (d = 0.88), and interventions for students with learning needs (d = 0.77). Weighted average 0.98 — one of the most powerful shelves in the dataset. No cognitive-work conflict on the student side. Medium substitution risk. And one mechanism powering all three rows.

The mechanism is **frequent evidence about a specific learner — or a specific teacher — interpreted by someone equipped to act, followed by an actual change in what happens next**. The loop's force is not in any single component. Screening alone is measurement. Intervention alone is hope. It is the closing — evidence changing action, repeatedly, on a short cycle — that compounds into the group's outsized effects.

The loop runs the same anatomy twice. RTI and learning-needs interventions run it on students: gather data, diagnose, intervene, measure response, adjust. Micro-teaching runs the identical loop on teachers, with the teacher's own practice as the patient. Both sit in the same group not because they resemble each other superficially but because they share the same structure — and, therefore, the same failure mode.

<!-- → [DIAGRAM: Two parallel loops — left loop labeled "Student intervention loop" (Screen → Diagnose → Intervene → Measure response → Adjust), right loop labeled "Teacher learning loop" (Teach → Record → Watch → Diagnose → Re-teach); both loops annotated showing which steps AI can feed and which steps require human judgment; arrow connecting them labeled "Same mechanism, same vulnerability"] -->

Notice what the loop runs on at each joint. The evidence steps — collection, aggregation, comparison — run on clerical cognition, high-volume and error-prone in human hands. Software does this better. The decision steps run on something else entirely: causal diagnosis, contextual knowledge, and professional accountability. *Is this child's flat trajectory a decoding problem, an attendance problem, an instruction problem, or a wrong-intervention problem?* The screener cannot see the family disruption behind the attendance dip. The platform cannot see the mismatch between this child's error pattern and the recommended package. And the delivery steps — the intervention itself, for the students who need it most — are trained-educator work the dataset does not hedge on.

Micro-teaching adds one brutal feature: the evidence is *you*. Its effect size lives in the confrontation — the gap between the lesson you remember teaching and the lesson the camera recorded — and in what that gap does to a teacher who examines it with a colleague. The confrontation is effortful and mildly painful, which is exactly why the AI summary sells. It offers the findings without the watching. But the findings were never the mechanism. The *seeing* was. A teacher told she talks 71 percent of the time has received a statistic. A teacher who watches herself talk over the same student's third attempt to answer has received a reason to change. The summary is to micro-teaching what the AI summary was to summarization: the artifact of an act whose value was in the performing.

## The Influences

**Response to intervention (d = 1.29)** — rank 5 of 252, and the number demands its caveat before its celebration. RTI is not a thing you buy. It is a whole-school system — universal screening, tiered support of increasing intensity, frequent progress monitoring, and data-based decision rules. The 1.29 comes substantially from studies of well-implemented systems under research conditions. Implementation dependence is the defining fact of this row: the same framework, run with infrequent monitoring, drifting decision rules, or interventions delivered by whoever was free, produces a fraction of the headline. By Kraft's benchmark realism, 1.29 should be read as *what the loop can deliver at high fidelity*, not what the label delivers on contact.

**Micro-teaching and video review of lessons (d = 0.88)** — rank 13. Teachers teach, record, review the recording with feedback, and re-teach. A provenance note: the classic evidence base skews toward teacher-preparation contexts and older studies, so treat the figure as strong support for the practice-review-revise cycle rather than a guarantee for any in-service program [verify]. The dataset marks AI video analysis — computer vision mapping talk-time, questioning, engagement — as the legitimate use case, with the teacher's own interpretation and changed practice as the human core.

**Interventions for students with learning needs (d = 0.77)** — rank 20. Targeted, structured, intensive instruction for students with identified needs. The dataset splits the row cleanly: AI-driven assistive tools, text-to-speech and interface adaptation, are legitimate augmentation. Specialized instruction and therapy require trained humans.

## What AI Can Safely Do

The safe zone is the loop's evidence steps — the surveillance and aggregation the loop has always starved on, and the tagging that routes humans into the moments worth their attention. Never the diagnosis. Never the decision. Never the delivery.

**Run the monitoring the loop starves without.** Continuous aggregation of screening scores, progress probes, attendance, and intervention logs; trajectory projection; flags raised with the evidence attached. The monitoring frequency high-fidelity RTI demands has always been rationed by human clerical capacity. This is the machine's lane.

**Draft for the Thursday table.** Pre-meeting briefs per flagged student — trajectory, intervention history, what's been tried, comparable-case patterns — so the team's hour goes to diagnosis instead of data archaeology. Drafted placements arrive as hypotheses with reasons, clearly labeled, never as defaults.

**Watch the fidelity.** Log whether the intervention actually ran — minutes delivered, sessions missed, group size drift. Implementation dependence means fidelity data *is* outcome data's leading indicator.

**Tag the video.** Talk-time, question taxonomy, cold-call distribution, wait time — and most usefully, timestamps: *here are the four moments where student talk died*. The machine finds the moments. The teacher watches them. Tagging that routes a teacher into the footage serves the mechanism. Summary that routes her around it deletes the mechanism.

**Carry the assistive layer.** Text-to-speech, adapted interfaces, accessible materials for learning-needs students — settled territory, under the specialist's plan.

## The Substitution Trap

**The rubber-stamped tier.** The platform drafts a placement. The team — six tired professionals at 3:40 on a Thursday — approves it. The minutes record a data-based decision. Automation bias does the rest: each approved draft makes the next approval easier, until the team is a ratification body and the diagnosis step has migrated into the model, where it consists of pattern-matching on the variables the platform can see. What the model cannot see is most of what the table exists for: the screener artifacts, the family context behind the attendance dip, the mismatch between this child's error pattern and the recommended package. The loop still closes. It closes on thinner causation, with no one's judgment actually engaged — and for the students at the margins of every distribution, thinner causation is misplacement.

**Platform minutes as Tier 2.** The delivery-side trap and the budget office's favorite: redefining the intervention itself as software time. *Tier 2 = 30 adaptive-platform minutes daily* is an arithmetic dream and a mechanism deletion. The d = 0.77 for learning-needs interventions belongs to structured, intensive, human-delivered instruction. The dataset's row says so without hedging. Adaptive practice can be a component. The moment it becomes the definition, the school is billing the influence's effect size for a different and weaker product.

**The unwatched self.** A teacher receives her AI lesson report, reads "consider increasing wait time," nods, files it. Next month, same. The PLC's watch-and-discuss hour becomes a report-discussion hour. The camera keeps rolling. Nobody watches anything. Every artifact of micro-teaching survives — recordings, analyses, reflection forms — except the confrontation that was the point. This trap is especially seductive because the avoided act is genuinely unpleasant. The tool isn't saving time so much as selling anesthesia, and practice that doesn't hurt a little usually isn't changing.

## The Case in Full

Lauren piloted both tools for one semester. Her implementation memo back to the district replaced "streamline" with a different verb: *feed*. The tools would feed the loops. Nothing would close them but people.

The platform caught what Thursday tables historically miss: a quiet second-grader whose progress probes were individually unremarkable but whose trajectory, plotted against intervention dosage, showed a child receiving Tier 2 on paper and roughly half of it in fact — her interventionist's schedule had been cannibalized by coverage duties. The flag was a fidelity catch, not a child defect. It redirected the team's response from "intensify the child's placement" to "protect the minutes." In the PLC, the video service's timestamping did what Lauren hoped: a fourth-grade teacher skeptical of talk-time ratios watched the four flagged moments where her questioning shut a discussion down and came to the next meeting having re-taught the lesson — the 0.88 cycle, running on machine-found moments and human eyes.

The dangerous moment came dressed as efficiency, in two costumes the same week. The intervention team, three Thursdays behind after testing season, voted to fast-track "obvious" cases by approving the platform's drafted placements without discussion. The first batch included a multilingual learner flagged for a decoding intervention whose "deficit" was, as the ELL specialist caught two weeks later, an artifact of screening a child in her second language. The draft had been plausible, confident, and wrong in precisely the way the table exists to catch. Same week, the principal — delighted with the video reports — proposed replacing the PLC's watch-and-discuss hour with a monthly "AI insights digest." Both proposals were the same proposal: remove the human act, keep its paperwork.

**The memo set four conditions.** Drafted placements are hypotheses: every platform recommendation is discussed against at least one alternative explanation, and the team's disagreements with the draft are logged — the log doubling as the platform's local error map and the team's best calibration record. No placement, exit, or intensification decision occurs outside the human meeting; the platform sets the agenda, never the outcome. Tier 2 and Tier 3 delivery is defined as human-delivered structured instruction; platform practice time may supplement, never constitute, the intervention, and fidelity dashboards report *human minutes delivered* as the headline metric. The video service is configured to require footage: reports unlock after the teacher has viewed her flagged moments, and the PLC hour remains watch-first.

Evidence for the whole pilot was set in advance: intervention-response rates and exit rates against the prior two years, decision-to-action latency, fidelity of delivered minutes, and — for the PLC — observed instructional change at re-teach, not report sentiment. The tools were good. The terms made them productive instead of just comfortable.

## What Would Change My Mind

Two results would rewrite the chapter. First: a credible trial in which algorithm-decided tier placements matched or beat human-team decisions on *student response outcomes* — not placement-prediction accuracy, which is circular — across diverse populations, including the multilingual and atypical learners where human catch-rates currently justify the table. The clinical-prediction literature outside education gives that possibility more respect than educators like to admit. If it lands, the Thursday meeting becomes quality assurance rather than diagnosis, and honesty would require saying so.

Second: evidence that AI lesson-summaries drive practice change equal to watched footage — that the confrontation is dispensable and the information was the mechanism after all. If teachers change as much from reading as from seeing, this chapter's anesthesia argument was sentimentality, and micro-teaching just got dramatically cheaper. Neither study exists yet. The loops, meanwhile, should keep their people.

## Still Puzzling

RTI's 1.29 contains a paradox this chapter manages rather than resolves: the influence is implementation-dependent, AI demonstrably improves implementation's evidence layer, and yet every implementation-improving tool creates a new way to fake the loop's closure. Whether net fidelity rises or falls under tooling is an empirical question no district is measuring cleanly.

The flagging threshold encodes a values choice nobody votes on. Tune it sensitive and the team drowns in false positives until automation bias becomes a survival strategy. Tune it specific and the quiet children the platform was bought for slip through. The vendor's default decides which failure mode a district gets.

Teacher video analytics sit one policy memo away from surveillance. The same tags that route a teacher to her own growth moments can route an administrator to her evaluation file. The micro-teaching evidence was earned under conditions of safety and self-confrontation. Nobody has measured what the camera teaches when it reports upward.

## Exercises

**Warm-up**

1. *(Recall — Mechanism)* The chapter claims one mechanism powers all three influences in this group. State it in one sentence. Then explain why the loop's force is not in any single component — what specifically happens when the loop closes on a short cycle that does not happen when any one component runs in isolation?

2. *(Recall — RTI caveat)* The chapter describes RTI's d = 1.29 as belonging to well-implemented systems under research conditions. What does "implementation dependence" mean for this row — and what does it imply about a district that adopts the RTI label, buys a flagging platform, and concludes it is "doing RTI"?

3. *(Recall — The unwatched self)* Explain why the AI lesson-summary trap is described as "selling anesthesia." What is the specific mechanism of micro-teaching that the summary bypasses, and why does bypassing it delete the effect rather than merely reduce it?

**Application**

4. *(Transfer — Loop audit)* Take a diagnostic or intervention loop from your own setting — MTSS, IEP progress review, instructional coaching, a PLC. Map it as four boxes following the chapter's model: gather evidence, diagnose, act, measure response. For each box, write who performs it today. Then write who would perform it if the most appealing AI tool in your current vendor landscape were fully adopted. Identify every box that flips from a person to a platform, and explain what the flip costs in terms of the mechanism.

5. *(Transfer — Memo clause)* Lauren's memo set four conditions. Take condition one — drafted placements discussed against at least one alternative explanation, disagreements logged — and draft it as implementation language specific enough that a new team member could follow it without further coaching. Then identify the most likely failure mode in practice and add a clause that closes it.

6. *(Transfer — Flagging threshold)* The Still Puzzling section notes that the platform's flagging threshold encodes a values choice nobody votes on. You are the MTSS coordinator writing the implementation spec for a new early-warning system. Write two paragraphs: one arguing for a sensitive threshold (flag more, risk more false positives) and one arguing for a specific threshold (flag fewer, risk more misses). Then name the local factor — specific to your setting — that should determine which you choose.

**Synthesis**

7. *(Combine — Fidelity as mechanism)* The chapter argues that fidelity data is outcome data's leading indicator for RTI. Using the four-link loop model and the fidelity-monitoring use case for AI, design a fidelity-monitoring protocol for a Tier 2 reading intervention in an elementary school: what the AI tracks, how often, what it flags, who receives the flag, and what the human response is. Your protocol should make clear at every step whether the AI is closing a loop link or feeding a human to close it.

8. *(Combine — Surveillance boundary)* The Still Puzzling section names a one-policy-memo distance between teacher growth and teacher surveillance. Design a video-analytics policy for a 500-student school that uses the micro-teaching research legitimately while preventing the footage and its analysis from flowing into evaluation. Specify: who can request a teacher's video data, who can see the AI tags, what the teacher controls, and what the mandatory safeguards are. Identify the one provision most likely to be violated under budget pressure, and explain why.

**Challenge**

9. *(Open — Human judgment reversal)* The chapter claims human-team diagnosis outperforms algorithm-decided tier placements for diverse populations, especially multilingual learners and atypical cases. The clinical-prediction literature outside education — Meehl's actuarial vs. clinical judgment research — suggests algorithms often beat humans in high-volume prediction tasks. Construct the argument that RTI placement should move to algorithmic decision-making with human review, rather than human decision-making with algorithmic recommendation. State the conditions under which the argument holds, what evidence would confirm it, and what the falsification condition is. Then evaluate honestly: does the multilingual-learner case from the chapter represent a solvable data problem for future algorithms, or a structural limit on what pattern-matching can diagnose?
